# **Project Idea**
I'm planning on creating a digital version of the game taboo. This is a game where a player has to describe a word, without saying any of the restricted words and the other players have to guess. I want to give the option of playing as teams or individually. While playing, there will be a time for one minute and buttons for the player to press when they want to skip a certain word or another player has guessed the word they are trying to describe. At the end of each round, there will an option to end the game or keep playing. The game will automatically end when all the cards have been used. Add sound and animation at the end of each round. Create 3d graph of each players stats at the end of the game.

# **Libraries**
