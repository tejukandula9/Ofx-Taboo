# **Project Idea**
I'm planning on creating a digital version of the game taboo using networks. This is a game where a player has to describe a word, without saying any of the restricted words and the other players have to guess. One player will be selected to describe and the other players will guess. The describing player can enter clues in a textfield. If the player uses the actual word or a restricted word, the game will automatically move on to the next card. The guessing players can also enter text into a textfield. If they guess right they will earn 2 points and the player describing will earn 1 point. There will also be a timer displayed and when time is up, a new player will be describing.
